This uses a python scrpit to write a short poem using a [Markov Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) and then creates an image out of it using ASCII values from characters in the string.

Since the Instagram API does not support posting images I am unable to really automate this as much as I would like. I may look into this more at a later date.

This code I've written is very sloppy!
I should have written it all in a single language but I just recycled some of my old code. Since I did not want to re write an image generator. I would like to make the image generation a bit better, but I don't know if I will.

This was not intended to have other users besides myself, so I'm aware of most of the errors and will not be fixing them.

# Installation
This program depends on imagemagick and Markovify which you can download with.
```pip install markovify```
To use simply run ```insta.sh```
