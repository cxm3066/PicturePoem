# This is pretty broken and I do not intend to fix it's issues!
This is some of the worst code I have written to generate a poem with Markov chains and use turn the poem into an image for use on Instagram.

Since the Instagram API does not support posting images I am unable to really automate this as much as I would like. I may look into this more at a later date.

This code I've written is very sloppy!
I should have written it all in a single language but I just recycled some of my old code. Since I did not want to re write an image generator. I would like to make the image generation a bit better, but I don't know if I will.

This was not intended to have other users besides myself, so I'm aware of most of the errors and will not be fixing them.

# Installation
